    "title": "1  My Paragliding Setup",
    "section": "1.3 Configuration",
    "text": "1.3 Configuration\n\n1.3.1 Poke 3 and XCTrack\nThe Poke graphical user interface (GUI) can be a bit peculiar at first. For example, it uses it’s own on-screen keyboard and it also has a, so called, ‘Navigation Ball’. It’s a small round blob that sits in front on any app you open. You’ll need it. If you click it, you’ll get access to more action buttons, and one commonly used one is the “back” button.\nIn order for XCTrack to go into landscape, which you can set inside XCTrack by going to ‘Preferences’ and then ‘Orientation’, you must configure the app such that it can override the ‘Rotation’ settings that the Poke GUI uses, which is ‘Portrait’ by default. To do this:\n\nLong press ‘XCTrack’ app icon\nSelect ‘Optimize’\nGo to the ‘Others’ tab\nDisable ‘Force to use system orientation’ (i.e. set it to OFF)\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Poke 3, BlueFlyVario, and XCTrack\nUse BlueFlyVario as an external GPS in XTrack:\n\nPairing: In Poke 3 Bluetooth settings, pair BlueFlyVario device (e.g. BlueFly-7D0D). No PIN required.\nEnable location: In Poke 3, open the ‘Control Center’ in the Poke 3/Android pulldown menu. There you should see WiFi and Bluetooth buttons at the very top. Below are two panels, both showing a set of icons that can be used to toggle settings on and off. The top panel, of these two, has a volume bar and the bottom one a brightness bar and a contrast bar. In the top panel, enable ‘Location’ by clicking on the map icon. This icon might be in the second “subscreen”, which you can get to by swiping left inside the panel. IMPORTANT: if this is not done, then you cannot connect the BlyFlyVario device in XCTrack (at least not on Poke 3).\nExternal GPS and External Barometer in XCTrack: In XCTrack, go to ‘Preferences’, then ‘Connections & Sensors’.\n\nUnder ‘Connection’, click ‘External sensors’, select ‘Bluetooth sensor’ and click ‘OK’. It will scan for paired Bluetooh devices. Select the BlueFlyVario device (e.g. BlueFly-7D0D).\nUnder ‘GPS’, enable ‘Use external GPS’. IMPORTANT: If you forget this, XCTrack will never recieve GPS data therefore only report on the lift and sink (from the barometer in BlueFlyVario). When it works, XCTrack will give the ‘GPS signal OK’ notification and it will show GPS altitute, the speed, flight arrow, and more even when on the group.\nUnder ‘Atmospheric pressure sensor’, enable ‘Use external barometer’. IMPORTANT: If you forget this, I think XCTrack will use the GPS data, which is much less sensitive, to report on lift and sink.\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 BlueFlyVario setting\nOptions to change hardware settings:\n\nAndroid: BlueFlyVario Android App (installable on Poke 3) Download: https://blueflyvario.com/files/BlueFlyVario.apk\nAny operating system: BFV Desktop Java Application Download: https://blueflyvario.com/files/BFVDesktop0.85.zip\n\nFor Poke 3, which does not have a speaker, change:\n\nUseAudioWhenConnected: true (default false)\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Recoil Media Button settings\nThis device broadcasts itself on Bluetooth as ‘PCR-1’. To pair to the Poke 3, go to the Bluetooth settings and locate ‘PCR-1’ under ‘Available devices’. Then click on ‘PCR-1’ to pair it. When paired it will appear under ‘CONNECTED DEVICES’. When powered off, it will be listed under ‘PAIRED DEVICES’, which are the devices that the Poke 3 remembers.\nWhen powered on, the Poke 3 will immediately connect to the Recoil Media Button device.\nThe device goes automatically into a sleep mode after 20 minutes. This is to preserve battery. Pressing any button (Previous track, Next track, Volumn Down, Volume Up, PAUSE/PLAY) will wake it up with very little delay.\nTo configure what the buttons should do, open XCTrack, go to ‘Preferences’, andthen ‘Key bindings’. I use the following settings:\n\nSwitch to page left: Previous track\nSwitch to page right: Next track\nZoom map in: None\nZoom map out: None\nToggle map panning: Long press: 85\nPan map LEFT in panning mode: Long press: Previous track\nPan map RIGHT in panning mode: Long press: Next track\nPan map UP in panning mode: Volumn Up\nPan map DOWN in panning mode: Volumn Down\nShow menu: None\nRevert to previous waypoint in task: None\nAdvance to previous waypoint in task: None\nIncrease display brightness: None\nDecrease display brightness: None"

See the Appendix for my notes on this.\n\n2.2.1 BOOXDrop\nEach BOOX device runs a built-in web server that can be access by other devices on the same local network (e.g. on the same WiFi network). [Comment: I need to figure out how to disable this /Henrik 2023-04-30]. To find the website address for your device,\n\nGo to ‘Apps’\nClick ‘BOOXDrop’ (might be grouped under ‘Onyx apps’)\n\nThat will should you a URL that looks something like http://192.168.1.8:8085, where 192.168.1.8 is the IP number of the device (yours will be different) on your local network (e.g. WiFi). The 8085 number at the end is a port number, and we all have the same one. If you’re lazy to type this in on your phone, you can scan the QR code.\n\nOpen your Poke’s BOOXDrop URL in your computer’s web browser. Your Poke and your computer must be connected to the same local network (e.g. WiFi). This will open up a webpage title ‘BOOX Drop’ where you can browser the files on your Poke, and upload (‘Send to BOOX’) and download (‘Save to Computer’) files."

The reason for this is that they are easy to get in the US, the cost is only 40-50 USD, so it’s not a biggie to get a replacement, keep a backup, and buy spare batteries. The Baofeng UV-5R handset uses the a Kenwood compatible two-pin plug; one plug is 2.5mm and the other is 3.5mm and are 12mm apart. Because of this, I have a fair bit of head sets with push-to-talk (PTT) buttons to choose from. The one I have is 25-35 USD from Amazon. I place the PTT button on my left riser near my break handle, because that way I can easily transmit also in active air and while thermalling. I have the headset and the mic mounted permanently on my helmet.\nOn launch, I put on my helmet, let the cable hang down before I close my jacket, then I connect it together with the PTT cable that I run down the riser thought the carabiner, and at the end I plug it to the radio that is on my flight deck. I then turn on the radio to confirm that I can hear “Frequency mode” or “Channel mode” that the radio says when turned on. After this, I do a formal radio check.\n\n\nComment: According to Wikipedia, “the model variant Boafeng UV5R HT” is no longer sold in Germany and Switzerland and may not be used there."

It worked great, but once in a while, and always during flying trips, the headset connection to the radio broke. The problem with the Yaseu FT-270R is that it has a screw-in plug (see picture). The purpose of that is so that the plug does not fall out, but the problem was that slowly you end up twisting the cable too much so that the cables inside break. It happened twice to me at launch during flying trips. I loved the custom-made Glidecom Cloudbase Headset, but it was custom built by a guy in Oregon and delivery was flaky at best, so this solution became unreliable in the long run. I never managed to find another nicec headset, so I switched to a cheaper, lower-quality Baofeng radio."
